                    Top 3 Myths about Lab Grown Diamonds
                </div>

                    #1: Lab grown diamonds are not real diamonds
                </div>
                <div className="blog-para" >
                    Man-made diamonds or lab created diamonds have the same chemical composition, refractive index, dispersion, hardness, density, and crystalline structure as mined diamonds. In fact, we would go so far as to say that they are identical in every way. Just that, one was found in nature; the other one was formed in a lab by the finest of craftsmen.

                <div className="blog-hash-title">
                    #2: Lab created diamonds are not forever
                </div>
                <div className="blog-para" >
                    Have you heard that saying: Diamonds are forever? Simple and elegant, isn’t it? And, what could be a better way to capture the timelessness of diamonds? Except that, we would like to take it one step ahead and make it say: Lab Grown Diamonds are forever.
                </div>
                <div className="blog-para" >
                    Since mined and man-made diamonds have the same chemical composition; they also share the same strength, durability and aesthetic appeal. They are diamonds, after all!

                <div className="blog-hash-title">
                    #3: Lab grown diamonds do not have any re-sale value
                </div>
                <div className="blog-para" >
                    Truth be told, this myth is more about mined diamonds than it is about man-made diamonds. Diamonds, like most gems, have intrinsic value that goes up with time. This may make one think that diamonds are good investments, and sure they are; but not if you buy them from a jewellery store at mark-up price. It will still have some resale value but you can’t expect to make an enormous profit unless you own a really rare piece of jewellery, purchased at a wholesale price. The same is true for lab created diamonds.

                <div className="blog-para" >
                    Also, it may interest you to know that irrespective of origin, diamonds are priced according to an internationally accepted pricing system which takes into consideration, the four Cs: carat, cut, clarity and colour. There is no discrimination there.

                <div className="blog-para" >
                    So, as a jeweller, you can educate your consumer about the fairness of the pricing strategy of lab grown diamonds, and about its re-sale value. This will help them to overcome their doubts and scepticism, and make an informed purchase.
